# Design Patterns Examples

This repository contains simple examples of common **Creational Design Patterns** in PHP.

---

## Factory Method  
**Definition:**  
A creational pattern that defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate.  
ðŸ‘‰ It focuses on creating **one type of product** at a time.  

**Example idea:**  
- `BMWFactory` creates a `BMWCar`.  
- `BenzFactory` creates a `BenzCar`.  

---

## Abstract Factory  
**Definition:**  
A creational pattern that provides an interface to create **families of related objects** without specifying their concrete classes.  
ðŸ‘‰ It ensures that related products are created consistently.  

**Example idea (Cars):**  
- `CarAbstractFactory` can create multiple related cars.  
- For example:  
  - `createBMWCar()` â†’ returns a `BMWCar`.  
  - `createBenzCar()` â†’ returns a `BenzCar`.  

**In this example:**  
We can use the same factory (`CarAbstractFactory`) to create different types of cars depending on budget or requirements, while keeping the creation logic centralized and consistent.  

---

## Builder  
**Definition:**  
A creational pattern that separates the construction of a complex object from its representation.  
ðŸ‘‰ It lets you create the same object step by step with different variations.  

**Example idea:**  
- `CarBuilder` builds a `Car` by setting engine, wheels, and color step by step.  
- Different builders can create **different types of cars** (e.g., `BenzCarBuilder`, `BMWCarBuilder`).  

---

## Pool  
**Definition:**  
A creational pattern that allows you to **reuse a set of objects** instead of creating and destroying them repeatedly.  
ðŸ‘‰ Useful when object creation is **expensive** in terms of time or memory.  

**Example idea:**  
- `CarPool` manages a pool of `Car` objects.  
- You can **get** a car from the pool, **release** it back, and reuse it instead of creating a new one.  

---

## Repository + Data Mapper  
**Definition:**  
The **Repository Pattern** provides a layer that separates the business logic from the data access logic.  
ðŸ‘‰ It allows your application to work with data as objects, without knowing how the data is actually stored or retrieved.  

The **Data Mapper Pattern** is responsible for transferring data between the in-memory objects and the database (or any data source) while keeping them independent from each other.  
ðŸ‘‰ It maps raw data (arrays, rows, JSON, etc.) into objects, and maps objects back into data for persistence.  

---

**Example idea:**  
- `UserRepository` provides high-level operations like `find()`, `save()`, and `delete()` for `User` objects.  
- `ArrayEntityManager` acts as the persistence layer (a simple in-memory database).  
- `UserDataMapper` converts between array data and `User` entity objects.  

**Example flow:**  
1. The application asks the repository: `find(1)`  
2. The repository calls the persistence layer to retrieve data for ID 1  
3. The persistence layer returns an array â†’ `['name' => 'ahmed', 'email' => 'ahmed@test.com']`  
4. The Data Mapper converts the array into a `User` object  
5. The repository returns the `User` object to the application  

---

**Benefits:**  
- Keeps business logic separate from data access logic  
- Makes the code easier to test and maintain  
- Allows switching between different data sources easily  
- Promotes a clean and modular architecture  

---

**In this example:**  
- `PersistenceInterface` â†’ defines basic operations for saving, retrieving, and deleting data  
- `ArrayEntityManager` â†’ provides an in-memory implementation of persistence  
- `UserDataMapper` â†’ converts data between arrays and `User` objects  
- `UserRepository` â†’ offers high-level methods to interact with `User` entities through the mapper and persistence layer
